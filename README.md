# AGRO 
#### This is an ecommerce project. This project focuses on the interaction between Farmers and WholeSellers. And our platform works as the middle man.

We Have implemented 3 modules in this project.  
- Admin
- Farmer/Seller
- Client/WholeSeller 

## Admin
Our platform is the *Admin*. Every transactions must go by the approval of *Admin*. 

The things that admin can do: 
1. Add Categories
2. See dashboard
3. Chat with Sellers
4. Activate any Seller account
5. Deactivate any Seller account
6. Approve transactions requests

It is the responsibility of the Admin to arrange these things properly. 

## Farmer/Seller
Farmer/Seller must create an account in our platform to access the facilities that our platform provides. He must connect a Stripe account for future transactions. To set his sccount active, he requires approval from the admin.
